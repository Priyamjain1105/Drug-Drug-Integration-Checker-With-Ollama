## 📌 Overview
This project leverages **Generative AI** to analyze drug interactions and assess their severity. By integrating **Flask**, **Ollama AI**, and a **beautiful UI**, users can input two drug names and receive AI-generated insights regarding:

- The severity level of interaction (Mild, Moderate, Severe)
- Details on potential side effects and risks
- Suggested alternative medications

## 🎯 Objectives
✅ **Enhance Drug Safety:** Help users understand possible dangerous drug interactions.  
✅ **AI-Powered Analysis:** Leverage Generative AI for medical insights.  
✅ **User-Friendly Experience:** Provide an intuitive UI with a visually appealing design.  
✅ **Assist Healthcare Professionals & Patients:** Support informed decision-making about medication combinations.  

---

## 🏥 Why This Project Matters?
Medication interactions can have severe health consequences. Doctors, pharmacists, and patients need an **efficient tool** to check whether two drugs can be taken together **without harmful effects**. This project aims to:

- **Reduce medication errors** 💊🚨
- **Provide instant AI-powered insights** ⚡
- **Suggest alternatives for safer treatments** 🔄

---

## 🧠 What is Generative AI?
Generative AI refers to artificial intelligence models capable of generating **new, meaningful content** based on training data. This project uses **Ollama AI** to generate accurate drug interaction insights dynamically.

🔹 **How it Works?**  
1️⃣ The user enters two drug names.  
2️⃣ The AI processes the input and predicts the severity level.  
3️⃣ It generates a detailed explanation of possible effects.  
4️⃣ If necessary, it suggests alternative medications.

## 📜 Prompt Used for AI Generation
We use the following prompt to guide the **Ollama AI model** for accurate drug interaction analysis:
```plaintext
Answer **only** in tuple format.
Question: Given two drugs {},{} tell about the severity of their interaction.
Use the format: (drug1_name, drug2_name, Severity Level, Details, Alternatives)
Output:
```
